HTC AudioManager Control lets you control the media player built in to TouchFLO 3D. It is currently a command-line based program that has the following available options:

**playpause** - Play/Pause the current song
**stop** - Stop the current song
**prev** - Go back to the previous track
**next** - Go to the next track

Feel free to use the AudioManagerControl class in your own projects :)
